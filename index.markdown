Hi, I am Mariia Tikhomirova, Berlin-based UX writer. I help businesses to communicate with users through text in the interface.

To do that I:
- ask a lot of questions to stakeholders (designers, developers, product managers, business owners, etc.) to get to know the product and who the users are, to understand business goals,
- read guidelines and manuals,
- work through user flow together with designers in Figma,
- analyze user research data with user researchers,
- keeping all that in mind, I write text. Then follow A/B tests, editing, adjusting. Iterate as needed.

I am looking forward for a new projects in Berlin. Interested and will be the most usefull when there's a need to take care of the text in the interface. Healthtech, femtech, edutainment, languages — wonderful. Gambling, microfinance, real estate — thank you, but no.

Remote, office or hybrid model of work. Russian (native speaker), English (speak and write fluently), German (telc C1 certificate).

 Let's keep in touch via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariiatikhomirova/), [email](mailto:uxwrtr@gmail.com).
