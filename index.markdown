Hi, I am Mariia Tikhomirova, a Russian-born, Berlin-based UX writer.
I help businesses to communicate with users through text.

I've been working with text for over a decade and have gravitated toward UX writing for about the last four years. What began as a small task of writing text for a button has evolved into a deeper knowledge of design, an empathic, people-oriented interface. Using my expertise in psychology I do my best to understand business goals, to get to know users, all that to create copy that works. Sometimes it will appear as an article, sometimes as a push notification, and sometimes even as an abscence of text.

Posts on this page show examples of my recent work.

I am looking forward for a new projects in Berlin. In case you need a UX writer (and if there's any text in any of interfaces that you develop, I believe, you do), please contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariiatikhomirova/) or [email](mailto:uxwrtr@gmail.com).
