Hi, I am Mariia Tikhomirova, a Russian-born, Berlin-based UX writer. I help businesses to communicate with users through text in the interface.

To do that I:
- ask a lot of questions to stakeholders (designers, developers, product managers, business owners, etc.) to get to know the product and who the users are, to understand business goals
- read guidelines and manuals
- go through user flow together with designers in Figma
- analyze user research data wit user researchers
- keeping all that in mind, I write text. Then follow A/B tests, editing, adjusting. Iterate as needed.

I am looking forward for a new projects in Berlin. Interested and will be the most usefull when there's a need to take care of the text in the interface. Healthtech, femtech, edutainment, languages — wonderful. Gambling, microfinance, real estate — thank you, but no.

Remote, office or hybrid model of work. Russian (native speaker), English (speak and write fluently), German (telc C1 certificate).

<b>Tools and environments:</b>
* Figma to work remotely together with designers
* Git, Github, Github Pages to maintain content versions and set up this site
* Asana, Trello, Github Projects to manage tasks
* Google Docs, Sheets and Visual Studio Code to work with text

<b>Recent education:</b>
* XSOLLA Summer Technical Writing School 2021
* Code Basics, basic course of Javascript
