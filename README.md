<p>Hi everybody! My name is Mariia Tikhomirova, I am a UX writer and editor, live in amazing Berlin.</p>
<p>UX writing helps business communicate with users â€” through text. With my knowledge of psychology, sincere interest in each stage of development, experience of work for companies of different scale, I try to create a clear copy that works. Sometimes it will apear as an article, sometimes as a short call-to-action on a button or a push notification, and sometimes as an absence of text.</p>
<p>Russian language (native), English (C1), German (C1, telc certificate). Figma fan, exploring docs-as-code approach.</p>
<p>I am open for job opportunities in Berlin. You are welcome to contact me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariiatikhomirova/">LinkedIn</a>.
