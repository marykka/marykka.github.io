<p>Pythagor was supposed to be a service for automatic boosting Facebook and Instagram ads, an easy and effective way for entrepreneurs and businesses to improve their Facebook and Instagram advertising. Unfortunately at some point Facebook changed its rules the way that made further development impossible.</p>
<p>I worked remotely with a team of designer, social media manager, developer and founder. Tools: Google Docs and Sheets, Trello, Figma, Tilda.</p>
