### pythagor.io copy and microcopy

### Project and context

pythagor.io was meant to be a service for entrepreneurs and small business owners, who don`t have a marketing department on-site and want to improve advertisement on Facebook and Instagram.

### Team and process

I worked as a writer and UX writer remotely with a team of project founder, developers, social media specialist, designer. All the collaboration went with Google Docs and Tilda. I came up with an idea of this name, and after that used the inspiration of Pythagoras, Greece, mathematics to form the content strategy.
