## iola.app copy and microcopy

### Project and context

iola.app was created as an alternative to a long and expensive mobile development. It is a plugin for websites, built on the Oxwall platform. The idea was simple: installing one mobile application iola, users could communicate with the website's owner or with their friends from other websites, which have the iola plugin connected.

### Team and process

I worked as a lead UX writer remotely with the international team. All the collaboration went with Google Docs (text drafts, editorial policy, etc.), Trello, Invision.

If you want to *read* the story, I  posted it here: [«UX writing for digital products: iola app»](https://teletype.in/@jstwrtng/-t9tjh3UR). Or just check out some examples of copy and microcopy here: only screenshots, no text.
