# Mariia Tikhomirova

Berlin-based UX writer, editor with 10+ years expirience working with different forms of a written word.

I understand UX writing as text form of communication between business and user. With my knowledge of psychology, sincere interest in each stage of development, experience of work for companies of different scale, I try to create a clear copy that works. Sometimes it will apear as an article, sometimes as a short call-to-action on a button or a push notification, and sometimes as an absence of text.

Russian language (native), English (C1), German (C1, telc certificate).

Figma fan, exploring docs-as-code approach.

I am open for job opportunities in Berlin. You are welcome to contact me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariiatikhomirova/">LinkedIn</a>.
