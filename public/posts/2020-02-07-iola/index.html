<p>iola.app was created as an alternative to a long and expensive mobile development. It is a plugin for websites, built on the Oxwall platform. The idea was simple: installing one mobile application iola, users could communicate with the website&rsquo;s owner or with their friends from other websites, which have the iola plugin connected.</p>
<p>I worked remotely with the international team of designer and two developers. Tools: Google Docs, Trello, Invision.</p>
